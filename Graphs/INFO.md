## Depth First Search (DFS)

- DFS is a **recursive** algorithm that uses idea of backtracking. 
- The term **'backtracking'** means that if you're moving forward from a certain node and there are no nodes available along that path, you move backwards on same path to find other nodes.


### Algorithm for DFS:
- Create a recursive function that takes index of starting node.
- Mark the current node as visited and print the node.
- Traverse all the adjacent and unvisited nodes and call the recursive function again with current node as index.

## Breadth First Search (BFS)

- BFS is a traversing algorithm where you should start traversing from a selected node (starting node) and traverse the graph layerwise/breadthwise thus exploring the neighbour nodes
